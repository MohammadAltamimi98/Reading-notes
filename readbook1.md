## Chapter 18
### PROCESS AND DESIGN 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <P> Before building a website you should consider the following questions and answer them.</p>

<ol>
<li> Who is your target audience?</li>
<li> What goals are you trying to achieve? </li>
<li> How often is your site visited?</li>
<li> Are you getting your messege across?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> The website builder should most definitely recognize his target audience whether its indivisuals or companies; as indivisuals should be focused on then classify them according to age, gender, wealth and income, geography etc.<br>If it was a company that you are targeting you should make sure they are aware of what these companies need, what are their budgets and how can you adverstise to them and get them under your hooks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### **Website structure and content**
<p> Before creating a website you should know how to structure your website, what are the main parts and what are the contents of each part.

Generally, the body is divided into three main parts:
<ul>
<li>The header.</li>
<li>The main part.</li>
<li>The Footer.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> You can use a site map to structure your webpage and a wirefram to arrange the content of each part and where is it loacted. </p>

## HTML5 layout
<p> The HTML5 layout really helps making the code clearer; so instead of having each section or element grouped and seperated by  div. 
Some of these new layout changes are the likes of header , footer and so on; all for the purpose of making it easier for the developer to write his code and revisit it and for other developers who are checking his code to understand easily.

> # NOTE:
>> <P> Not all web browsers understand HTML5; hence  some browsers need updates (like Internet explorer 8 or older), where additional JS should be added.</P>
</p>

## Extra MARKUP
### DOCTYPE
each web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell the
browser which version of HTML
the page is using.

### Comments in HTML
<p> comments can be written using the synatax: 

```<!-- comment -->```
</p >

<p>In the head, you will find some meta information about your webpage.<br>
Make sure to change the title of the document to your chosen title; this will appear on the browser tap title.
