# A Git intro

##  what is a version control system?
 Version control is a system that allows you to visit previous versions of your code and gives you the ability to track your modification and adjustments and convert your work back to previous versions, this ultimately helps with mistakes detection easily.
 
### What are the types of **VCS**?
1. Local Version Control
A local VC means that there's one database which is located on your hard drive - PC.

2. Centralized Version Control
This type allows collaboration, different developers can access this. It will be saved on a single server and thus all changes will be saved there.


3. Distributed Version Control
If the CVC goes down in the then the other developers won't be able to access the repositories and hence that is the biggest failure of the CVCS. From there came up the need for a new CVS. The idea of the DVCS is that each team member will have a mirrored repository.


## What is Git? 
Git is a DVCS that stores every change you make as a snapshot in a data file, it heavily relies on local operations because the bulk of the information needed will be stored in local resources. Not only that Git tracks every single little change, but also it is made in a way that prevents any serious loss or damage to the information it holds. Git exists in three state; committed, modified and staged.
