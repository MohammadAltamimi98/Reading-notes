## what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

## How to Solve Programming Problems

### common mistake:
 - Is trying to start writing code as soon as possible.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 ## a simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem.

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.
