# Read: Class 09 - Readings: FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING





## What is functional programming?
- Functional programming languages are specially designed to handle symbolic computation and list processing applications. Functional programming is based on mathematical functions. Some of the popular functional programming languages include: Lisp, Python, Erlang, Haskell, Clojure, etc.

## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function? (Links to an external site.)
- The Pure function always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed in. It does not depend on any state, or data, change during a program’s execution. It must only depend on its input arguments.

## what is immutability in programming (Links to an external site.)
- In object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object (unchangeable object) is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. … For example, an object that uses memoization to cache the results of expensive computations could still be considered an immutable object.

## The Benefits of Pure Functions:
1. They’re easier to reason about

2. They’re easier to combine

3. They’re easier to test

4. They’re easier to debug

5. They’re easier to parallelize


## Features of Functional Programming
- We can’t discuss the benefits of Functional Programming without discussing its features. Here are some of the most notable features of Functional Programming:

- First-Class Citizen Functions
What’s good about Functional Programming is its functions are first-class citizens: you can always insert functions inside a function without any restrictions present.



> There are no mutations or shared states allowed, as functions should be pure and true to their representation in this paradigm. It is declarative rather than formal or imperative.
