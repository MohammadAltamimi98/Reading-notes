## What is a ‘call’?
- At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
- one
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## What does LIFO mean?
- Last In, First Out.


<p>&nbsp;</p>


## What causes a Stack Overflow?

- A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.


<p>&nbsp;</p>

## What is a ‘refrence error’?
- Creates an instance representing an error that occurs when de-referencing an invalid reference.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## What is a ‘syntax error’?
-Creates an instance representing a syntax error.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## What is a ‘range error’?
 - Creates an instance representing an error that occurs when a numeric variable or parameter is outside of its valid range.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## What is a ‘type error’?
- Creates an instance representing an error that occurs when a variable or parameter is not of a valid type.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## What is a breakpoint?
- In software development, a breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes. It is also sometimes simply referred to as a pause.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
- The debugger statement stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function. Using the debugger statement has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the code. <p>&nbsp;</p>
