# 14. Read: Class 14 - Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry



## 1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
-  The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

- And these pc's were marketed almost entirely to men and boys.

- This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative. 

- Movies with plots that  promotes the story of that awkward geek boy genius who uses tech savvy to triumph over adversity and win the girl.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## 2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
- because computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home.

## 4. When are diversity efforts most successful?
- Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## 5. Why do diverse companies perform better?

- Diverse teams are smarter and more creative & Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>


## 6. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
- When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. 

- example: When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.
