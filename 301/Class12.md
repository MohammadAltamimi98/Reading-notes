## 1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
## 2. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

-  SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage.
 - But, NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.
 - NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.

 ## 3. Which type of database is best for scalability?

- QL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. 
- SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. 
- NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.

## What does SQL stand for?
- Structured Query Language

## What is a realational database?
- A relational database is a type of database. It uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. Often, data in a relational database is organized into tables.
<p>&nbsp;</p>



## What is a ‘schema’?
- The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into database tables in the case of relational databases). The formal definition of a database schema is a set of formulas (sentences) called integrity constraints imposed on a database.
<p>&nbsp;</p>



## What is a NoSQL database?
- NoSQL Database is a non-relational Data Management System, that does not require a fixed schema.
<p>&nbsp;</p>




## What is inside of a Mongo database? 
- records that consist of documents such as json.
<p>&nbsp;</p>



## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
- MongoDB. No strict schema.
<p>&nbsp;</p>


## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
- They don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID).
