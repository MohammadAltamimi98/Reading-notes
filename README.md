## A SUMMARY

### What is a growth mindset?

A growth mindset denotes that persistence and putting your effort into doing something will most definitely result in growing and improving your abilities; intelligence and talent are only a good kick-start but not actual determinants of the end result nor your growth and learning process. A growth mindset is often synonymous with a dynamic mindset which  allows you to create interest and momentum to move your ideas forward, take concrete steps to make your ideas reality and take advantage of novel opportunities that might otherwise go untapped. Consequently, you will be able to lead others with energy and confidence.



### Growth mindset Vs. Fixed mindset

A growth mindset means that you believe your intelligence and talents can be developed over time, and thus you can learn anything and no matter how hard it is at the beginning you know it will get easier and better with time. A fixed mindset means that you believe intelligence is fixed—so if you're not good at something, you might believe you'll never be good at it, and thus you will no longer try to work on it or work on improving yourself; giving up becomes inevitable.

> **A fixed mindset, proposed by Stanford professor Carol Dweck in her book Mindset describes people who see their qualities as fixed traits that cannot change. With a fixed mindset, talent is enough to lead to success and effort to improve these talents isn’t required: one is born with a certain amount of skill and intelligence that can’t be improved upon.**
