## - INTRODUCTION & SCRIPT

 How does Jave script make the web Page more interactive?
 1. Access the content of the page
2. Modify the content of the page
3. Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
4. React to events triggered by the user or browser

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### The alert messege 
- we use this to alert the user about anything we want especially important things.

`alert("hi");`

<p>&nbsp;</p>

> the console is used by developers only to trace our code and how it is changed

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

## Expressions and operators

### Data types:

1. Strings like "a" , 'b'

2.  Numbers like 5, 2.5, -2.5

3. Boolean either true or false


### Operators:
1. Assignment operator (=) :it is used to assign values to variables.
2. Comparison operators (==,!= , <, >, <=, >=, ====, !== , etc. )
 3. Arithmatic operators (+, - *, /, %, etc.)
4. logical operators ( && , ||, ! )
 <p>&nbsp;</p>

 >THE && Operator always returns false unless the two compared values are both true, but the || operator always returns true unless we have two falses in our compared values.
 >> The Not operator changes the value of the output; from true to false and from false to true.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

 The (*prompt*) is used to display a messege and ask for input from the user. Using the following syntax:

 `prompt("please enter your name")`

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 ### The (IF-CONDITION) statement

```{

if (condition)
{
statments run when condition is true
}
else
{
    statements run when condition is false
}

}
```

We use the contanetation to put two things side by side.
> 'a'+'b' = ab
