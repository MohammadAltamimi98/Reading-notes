## what is an object?
An object groups together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you  would recognize from the real world. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>


> In an object, variables and functions take on new names.


<p>&nbsp;</p>

what are  **VARIABLES** called in an object and what is their job? 
- They become known as Properties 
- They tell us about the object.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

what are  **FUNCTIONS** called in an object and what is their job? 
- If a function is part of an object, it is called a method. 
- Methods represent tasks that are associated with
the object.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

> properties and methods have a name and a value. 
> In an object, that name is called a key.
