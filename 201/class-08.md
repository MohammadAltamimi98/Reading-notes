## What's the difference between **Block-level** & ** Inline** elements ?

- Block-level elements start on a new line Examples include:
`<h1> <p> <ul> <li>`

- Inline elements flow in between surrounding text Examples include:
`<img> <b> <i>`



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



> If one block sits inside another block then the the outer block is called the parent element.

> when multiple elements sit together we usually use `<div>` to group them. 



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


## The position of elements can be :
- Normal flow:
     - static
     
- Relative.
- Absolute.
- fixed
- overlapping elements : use the z-index.

## Some factors you need to take in consideration when designing the layout of your web page:

- Screen sizes effects.
- Screen Resolutions effects.
- page sizes.



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Type of layouts:
- Fixed layout: it doesn't change size no matter what the size of the browser window was.
- Liquid layout: the design changes to fit the screen.
