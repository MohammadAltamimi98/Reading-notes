## The researchers found that there were five key characteristics of enhanced teams:
<p>&nbsp;</p>


1. Psychological safety: Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.

2. Dependability: Everyone completes quality work on time.

3. Structure and clarity: Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.

4. Meaning: Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).

5. Impact: Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.

## What are the differences between work group and teams ?
- Work groups are characterized by the least amount of interdependence. They are based on organizational or managerial hierarchy. Work groups may meet periodically to hear and share information.

- Teams are highly interdependent - they plan work, solve problems, make decisions, and review progress in service of a specific project. Team members need one another to get work done.







## According to Researcher Gary Burnison:


Researchers found that the poorest-performing teams were 100 percent ‘pragmatic’ and had 0 percent ‘relationship-building’ traits.
