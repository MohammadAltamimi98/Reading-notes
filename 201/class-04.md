## ***FUNCTIONS***

### What is a function?

- A function is a way to group multiple statements and execute them all at once.

- we use functions to avoid repetition, and to make our code clearer and readable. Also, it helps with organizing and classifying our code.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### How to declare a function?

- we use the following syntax to declare a function.

## Global vs. local variables:

- GLOBAL VARIABLES: are variable that are defined throughout the script. They can be called in any part of the script.

- LOCAL VARIABLES: are variables that are defined only in the scope of a function and can't be used outside a function; it will be considered undefined.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

> Global variables take more memory because they will be running all the time in that web page; unlike local variable which will take less memory because they will only be used when the function is to be executed.

## Links
---
Are really what makes the term "surfing the web". links allow you to travel to other websites, other pages, parts of pages, emails or opens a whole new tab.


### How to write a link?

> " URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. Every web page has its own URL. This is the web address that you would type into a browser if you wanted to visit that specific page." 
> - Duckett:HTML,CSS

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Relative Vs. Absolute links

An absolute URL starts with the **domain name** for that site, and can be followed by the path
to a specific page. If no page is specified, the site will display the homepage.

When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as **a relative URL**.
