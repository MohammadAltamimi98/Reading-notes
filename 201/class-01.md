### Introduction (pa 2-11)
---
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

 **what is a web browser ?**<br>
 It is a software that we use to access websites.
 <p>&nbsp;</p>

 **what is a web server ?**<br>
 It is a computer that hosts the website and is always connected to the internet.
 <p>&nbsp;</p>

  **How are websites created?**<br>
  websites are usually created using HTML and CSS. Some websites use JS or Flash and most would use some content like audio, video etc.
 <p>&nbsp;</p>


  **how does the web work ?**<br>

  1. You connect to the internet using an Internet Service Provider (ISP). 

  2. Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books; they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name.[1]
  


3. The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server.

4. The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.
 <p>&nbsp;</p>

  > "An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods or full stops. Every
device connected to the web has a unique IP address; it is like the phone number for that
computer."[2]

### Structure (pa 2-11)
---
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  - We use HTML mainly to define the structure of our web page.

  - the Code of a HTML page usually will have the following format:
```
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>



</head>
<body>


    
    



</body>
</html>
```

> As we can see the code format will first define the document type as HTML.
> then we should start the HTML tag and whatever code we write should always be inside this tag.<BR>

> - The code is divided into two parts : 
>> 1. the head: whatever is in the head doesn't show on the page; usually for styles and linking elements to the HTML.
>> 2. the body: this part is shown on the page and this is where content is contained.
