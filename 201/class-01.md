### Introduction (pa 2-11)

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

 **what is a web browser ?**<br>
 It is a software that we use to access websites.
 <p>&nbsp;</p>

 **what is a web server ?**<br>
 It is a computer that hosts the website and is always connected to the internet.
 <p>&nbsp;</p>

  **How are websites created?**<br>
  websites are usually created using HTML and CSS. Some websites use JS or Flash and most would use some content like audio, video etc.
 <p>&nbsp;</p>


  **how does the web work ?**<br>

  1. You connect to the internet using an Internet Service Provider (ISP). 

  2. Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books; they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name.[1]
  


3. The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server.

4. The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.
 <p>&nbsp;</p>

  > "An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods or full stops. Every
device connected to the web has a unique IP address; it is like the phone number for that
computer."[2]

### Structure (pa 2-11)
---
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  - We use HTML mainly to define the structure of our web page.

  - the Code of a HTML page usually will have the following format:
```
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>



</head>
<body>


    
    



</body>
</html>
```

> As we can see the code format will first define the document type as HTML.
> then we should start the HTML tag and whatever code we write should always be inside this tag.<BR>

> - The code is divided into two parts : 
>> 1. the head: whatever is in the head doesn't show on the page; usually for styles and linking elements to the HTML.
>> 2. the body: this part is shown on the page and this is where content is contained.

## WHAT IS MARKDOWN?
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.

> MARKDOWN extension is  '.md' or `.markdown`.

## **what is CSS ?**
---
It is short for cascading style sheets.
why do we use it ? we use it to change the styling an layout of our web pages.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### How do we use it ?
- Inline : it is included in the same tag in the HTML file.

- External: it is saved on a seperate file with the extension `.css `.

- Internal: within the same HTML file but will not be included within the body of the webpage; rather it will be included in the head part of the webpage.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### How the inline method works?<br>

`<p style="color:red;"> `

<p>&nbsp;</p>


### How the internal method work?<br>

``` <head>
<style>
p{color: red ;}
</style> 
</head>
```
### How the external method work?<br>
```
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href"styles.css" >
</head>
```


### PROCESS AND DESIGN 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <P> Before building a website you should consider the following questions and answer them.</p>

<ol>
<li> Who is your target audience?</li>
<li> What goals are you trying to achieve? </li>
<li> How often is your site visited?</li>
<li> Are you getting your messege across?</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p> The website builder should most definitely recognize his target audience whether its indivisuals or companies; as indivisuals should be focused on then classify them according to age, gender, wealth and income, geography etc.<br>If it was a company that you are targeting you should make sure they are aware of what these companies need, what are their budgets and how can you adverstise to them and get them under your hooks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### **Website structure and content**
---
<p> Before creating a website you should know how to structure your website, what are the main parts and what are the contents of each part.

Generally, the body is divided into three main parts:
<ul>
<li>The header.</li>
<li>The main part.</li>
<li>The Footer.</li>
</ul>
</p>
