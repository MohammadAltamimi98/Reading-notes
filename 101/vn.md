# VIDEOS NOTES:

## What makes a computer a computer ?<br>

A computer does three main essential things:<br>
1. Takes in **INPUTS**. 
2. **PROCESSES** these inputs.
3. Gives out **OUTPUTS**<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Types of inputs:<br>
Mouse clicking and moving, keyboard keys pressed, touch (phones and touchpads), etc.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## what happens in the processing stage?<br>
The computer takes the inputs and store them then it processes them by running a set of Algorithms which instruct the stored data how to interacat and behave; then it us sent to the outputs.
<p>&nbsp;</p>


## What are the many forms of output?<br>
Outputs can vary from a display on the screen to a sound or a game etc.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## How is information stored?<br>
wires and circuits store information in them using electricity, where each wire represengt a bit that can have two states either one or zero.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


## What is the binary numbering system?<br>
It is a system where every number can be represented by (1, 0). With the mathematical rule 
(2^x), and the more wires we have the more numbers we can represent (by 32 wires we can represent from 0 to 4 billions)

## How can you represent text in Binary?<br>
Each letter can be represnted by numbers and so on.
<p>&nbsp;</p>


## How can you represent images in binary?<br>
Each pixel on the screem has a colour and each colour can be represented by a number.
<p>&nbsp;</p>


## How processors work?<br>
Millions of tiny electrical circuits and wires work together with the help of logic gates to process information.
<p>&nbsp;</p>


## What are Logic gates?<br>
Logic gates are elements that can be added to the circuit to do a specific operation just like the (NOT, AND, NOT) gates.
<p>&nbsp;</p>



## Why are smaller computers faste?<br>
Because the smaller the computer (i.e the smaller the processing unit) the smaller the circuit which means less distance for electricity to go through.
